# Cassette-BBQ

A short game created for the "***30 Days Of Summer***" game jam on itch.io.

In this fun and casual cooking challenge, you grill burgers and sausages to fill customer orders before time runs out. 

Keep an eye on cooking times — burning or wasting food will hurt your score!

**Get flipping, frying, and serving** — can you become the ultimate grill master before the timer runs out, or will the Lo-Fi beats slow your hustle?



You can download the built game on its **[Itch.io page](https://kyanberunokage.itch.io/cassette-bbq)**.

### Planned Features:

- **Pause menu for when the player is currently playing a round and wishes to exit without losing save data.**

- **Two more cassette powers/modes to change the way you play.**

- **Further balancing the unlock requirements for the cassette powers/modes.**

- **GUI for displaying what each cassette does when hovered over** *(although I do like the idea that players aren't fully aware of what each cassette does before they use them)*

- **Achievements/Challenges** *(Maybe)*

- **Feel free to leave a message on the Itch.io page for the game if you have suggestions for what I should add.**
  
  

### Will I be building for Mac in the future?

Not likely. The Apple licensing is far too much for me to pay since game dev is only a hobby of mine, and I don't feel like going through the hassle to push my game to Mac.
